# Create and deploy a Python Flask web application

> We have similar applications available for [Django](https://github.com/IBM/django-web-app), [Go](https://github.com/IBM/go-web-app), [Java Liberty](https://github.com/IBM/java-liberty-web-app), [Swift](https://github.com/IBM/swift-web-app), [Spring](https://github.com/IBM/spring-web-app), and [Node](https://github.com/IBM/nodejs-web-app).

In this sample web application, you will create a Python web application using Flask. This application contains an opinionated set of files for web serving:

- `public/index.html`
- `public/404.html`
- `public/500.html`

## Steps

You can [deploy this application to IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/developer/appservice/create-app?starterKit=b5fab23f-1b6b-37bc-8736-c90dc6973a0c) or [build it locally](#building-locally) by cloning this repo first. Once your app is live, you can access the `/health` endpoint to build out your cloud native application.

### Deploying to IBM Cloud

</p>

Use the button above to deploy this same application to IBM Cloud. This option will create a deployment pipeline, complete with a hosted Git lab project and DevOps toolchain. You will have the option of deploying to either Cloud Foundry or a Kubernetes cluster. [IBM Cloud DevOps](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/devops) services provides toolchains as a set of tool integrations that support development, deployment, and operations tasks inside IBM Cloud. 


### Building Locally

To get started building this application locally, you can either run the application natively or use the [IBM Cloud Developer Tools](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started) for containerization and easy deployment to IBM Cloud.

#### Native Application Development

* Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
 
Running Flask applications has been simplified with a `manage.py` file to avoid dealing with configuring environment variables to run your app. From your project root, you can download the project dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run your application locally:

```bash
python manage.py start
```

`manage.py` offers a variety of different run commands to match the proper situation:
* `start`: starts a server in a production setting using `gunicorn`.
* `run`: starts a native Flask development server. This includes backend reloading upon file saves and the Werkzeug stack-trace debugger for diagnosing runtime failures in-browser.
* `livereload`: starts a development server via the `livereload` package. This includes backend reloading as well as dynamic frontend browser reloading. The Werkzeug stack-trace debugger will be disabled, so this is only recommended when working on frontend development.
* `debug`: starts a native Flask development server, but with the native reloader/tracer disabled. This leaves the debug port exposed to be attached to an IDE (such as PyCharm's `Attach to Local Process`).

There are also a few utility commands:
* `build`: compiles `.py` files within the project directory into `.pyc` files
* `test`: runs all unit tests inside of the project's `test` directory

Your application is running at: `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.
- Health endpoint: `/health`

There are two different options for debugging a Flask project:
1. Run `python manage.py runserver` to start a native Flask development server. This comes with the Werkzeug stack-trace debugger, which will present runtime failure stack-traces in-browser with the ability to inspect objects at any point in the trace. For more information, see [Werkzeug documentation](http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/).
2. Run `python manage.py debug` to run a Flask development server with debug exposed, but the native debugger/reloader turned off. This grants access for an IDE to attach itself to the process (i.e. in PyCharm, use `Run` -> `Attach to Local Process`).

#### IBM Cloud Developer Tools

Install [IBM Cloud Developer Tools](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started) on your machine by running the following command:
```
curl -sL https://ibm.biz/idt-installer | bash
```

Create an application on IBM Cloud by running:

```bash
ibmcloud dev create
```

This will create and download a starter application with the necessary files needed for local development and deployment.

Your application will be compiled with Docker containers. To compile and run your app, run:

```bash
ibmcloud dev build
ibmcloud dev run
```

This will launch your application locally. When you are ready to deploy to IBM Cloud on Cloud Foundry or Kubernetes, run one of the commands:

```bash
ibmcloud dev deploy -t buildpack // to Cloud Foundry
ibmcloud dev deploy -t container // to K8s cluster
```

You can build and debug your app locally with:

```bash
ibmcloud dev build --debug
ibmcloud dev debug
```
